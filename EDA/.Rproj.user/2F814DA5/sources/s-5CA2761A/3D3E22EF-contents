quality move away from crystal left it a bit messy no data cleansing Relying on output of inherited stored procs Joining all the databases manually no unique id across dbs Manually tracking mapping of names in dbs for queries applies to customers as well as agents within the business Housekeeping around data is poor poor ownership or governance Found data in db from 2007 Booking tools have

columns of formulae Slow Segregation of data Good people comparmentalised across the business lack of knowledge and skill share Complex data sources disparate silos no single version of the truth bring it all together Customers have different names across data streams e g Hotel partnership change of hotel id when names are changed etc Different data management approaches between teams makes

ensure it present then move data into CRM for future updates Originally customers to MI team All new to him learning from Kerry and team Historically single points of failure people E g if Anna left no crystal reports SSRS has 20 reports for hotels each with different subscriptions changing report formats no raw data Missing data mapping data between divisions How did bookings get through without data validations pass Divisions come from HR teams some automated into Daves tables some not manual update once they receive them Feels relatively new moved into role in Aug Sept Still working out CTE SSRS On NYS side data quality Automated stuff part SQL part Macro Get data from SQL quality check in excel lookup then run macros to distribute data to reports MI piece Suspect the trip aggregation system wrong How to logically group trips and assign individual trip ref provide single point of truth for billing and reporting Ideally itinerary store to be used for central reporting tracking billing etc Been in the pipeline for 2 years Modular design to swap in out travel tracking providers Historical issues with Replications hotel prod db being replicated to derby Mid office replicated

delete then reinstate Still has data from 2011 Where are we going with Pluto or system that drives it Mars Might be getting rid so why fix 1 Lots of manual processes e g No self service facility to create reports have the tools but never set up 2 Data quality biggest concern input fields are free text leading to mismatching inputs rather than using dropdowns Typos etc causes issues with joining tables 3 Havent got master code to link systems separate client codes in each systems 1 No data warehouse were looking to invest but didn’t Data isnt clean Access to data is easy but booking system is siloed Accom and travel going into meetings pro which is for events Transact travel through mars as solution Data non uniform Used views to create datasets but then started cleaning and creating view in massive flat file for MIS dept reporting doesnt include all products missing coaches taxis events Some data is suspect use of dummy accounts to add data Biggest issue is way data is held not defined way to deal with a booking Different people use different systems then must be re assembled Safe accounting midway between group SAP and Safe Sage Rather than merging the two still operating two accounting systems Doesnt understand decisions with it Safe promised access to data but couldnt had to create queries for them to bring data out of the environment 3 Amount of data thats spread around the amount of times a report kpi insight has gone through Reports being created for no reason Siloed processes should be automated and blended E g someone creating online report many ways to calculate KPI based on metrics cant tell who uses what etc 1 Prep of customer reviews presentation travel spend summary manually populating chart data from dashboard to add into powerpoint Capita group Used powerbi tool to create display re travel reason Data handoff to india monthly for report creation saving initiates Need something similar in CTE used to take 10 hours to create now instantly Data from excel QBR template macro pulls together info outdated quickly cant change data Can be used to cut paste graphics Exec summary excel based run each month no drill down slow to create pack 2 Maniuplating data and generating presentations 3 Rollouts of PowerBI 1 In business AM team biggest cust to internal MI Where account mgr thinks its come from MI its had more work from

no centralised reporting 3 Maintaining reports promising reports and having to build new reports massive suite to support to everyone 1 Data quality MI short medium term marry up billing with reporting Hotels eg 2 separate extracts 1 to financial and 1 to reporting neither matches Itinerary store to resolve and marry up whole trips for source of truth Consistency! Build the data warehouse now looking to go down azure lake ADF SQL engineering A lot of manipulation of data when it comes in would like to get closer to source data Better tools update legacy tools and data Skill sharing has list of love to dos and love to knows Wants to automate POA analysis streamline and help show when value has been delivered to customers Generate dashboards to customers quickly accessibly Allow customer to run whatifs quickly to see what changes Help identify who customer can talk to to change behaviours to improve life costs etc All about letting customers access reports Reflecting on this Is report still relevant cycle of updating dashboards Depends on future plans BI Manager discussing move into Azure data lake then sit reporting on top but then he left Since 4 master reporting tables implemented as a result of crystal reports removing Lots of data silos since users given accessed no central reporting tier to ensure everyone uses the same calculations Problems with mapping keys users across dbs Could use more tools in addition to powerquery freshcalls paginates 30 records at a time Has to use contact list from inbound emails to merge Needs server to crunch the data Training people sitting back waiting to be fed receiving wrong data Back and fourth asking for data resolve self serve issue People have the data but dont know how to filter produce it Structured training level of work in Excel is excessive isnt fit for purpose takes too long Repeat next month Facilitate use of PowerBI Excel spend a lot of time producing the data sets Reconcile air tickets found rail ticket in insight which shouldnt be there Hotel industry behind getting MI rubbish Most hotels ask them how much spent not other way round Due to being small team knowledge sharing needed Siloed information and skills Lost knowledge due to the Rona staff level E g macros Initial project using ADLS Gen2 pushing data in for connection to power bi Stripping back all processing taking SQL extract to ADLS as source data Delayed when replacement DB left and whole MI team lost POC to provide data to end customers for reporting Online MI via 3rd party Plan to move to another 3rd party for hotels cancelled due to pandemic Crystal reports mostly migrated to SSRS Itinerary store for trip hotel taxi ferry flights Azure migration 2 attempts at data warehouse initial findings completed by external then dropped 2nd time cost balooned and stopped Ideas there never really progressed Series of tactical deployments while awaiting impending warehouse that never materialised Reporting is ignored when looking at new products E g Freshdesk brought in prior was using outlook piloting showed issues with reporting limited APIs incomplete information eg Individual interactions on a ticket rather than just total and pagination issues Manually exporting data for historical reports due to API limitations stale data if old records are updated Freshcalls bought on commerical functional benefits but not given consideration to the reporting API possibly to upsell their reporting tools Exeon really good built into azure Avaya really good for reporting CDRs archived well On rail challenge cant tell easily that two singles are together Could calculate an indicator to show that format of purchase Move people away from anytime returns towards singles etc calculate how ticket type could change Trying to generate reports where they can estimate how much saving through smarter working based on customer spend on travel profile Customer program optimisation Avoid unnecessary travel do so smartly do with wellbeing in mind Data warehousing nice to have price wasnt nice to see Process with wrong people Took a while to get off the ground price increased Shift from in house sales purchase ledger commission claims into Safe system as project progressed essentials where missed from functionality overpriced and not fit for purpose Run away with some projects progress without planning speaking to key stakeholders culture Positive created reporting on recovery algorithms work out when getting back to business as norm currently 10% than pre covid People wanting to reach out and see info Pre plan staffing etc Data quality over quantity Success PowerBI dashboards Painful creating script to show what he wanted 30hrs to show design now produces report instantly efficiency quality of report better 10 hours to produce reports manually Previously in online fulfilment team ingestion from teams was manual Automated data input with Macros Automate at source not down the line Automating QBRs reliant on macros not well documented When in Acct Management support team Ams would bring power point deck and ask for analysis for them 5 6 hours Build template for it mapping data to slides Button press imports data into Excel Firefighting typicially fix a problem rather than improving processes MI with 3rd party Requires daily weekly csv extract Nothing at the moment New online MI tool with Unlock Data using flat tables Using Defra CO2 for hotels integrated into existing lookup tables Was hoping to start the reporting env but delayed 90 day plan last minute find savings for my renewing customer Centralised process to track savings across customers provide single source of total savings for customer Also pro active highlight how more savings could be made make recommendations Compare to other customers Scorecard tiles on dashboard navigate reports External facing MI Unlock Data gives customer access to better dashboard than internal possibly give customer more info than internal have Reviewing commercial models capturing infor re contracts into CRM slickening input but not re data Kerry Chris Savings tracker project Pull through metrics of savings across business and understand how theyre worked out make sure its consistent across the board Automate gathering the data Dave getting CO2 data Air Rail Defra Hotels using old system moving to new Working on feeds making sure theyre ok before automated Big one Migration to meetings pro Attempting to move existing CTE to meetings pro data Streamlining raw data reports to customers reduce from 20 slight variations one more capable that supported different parameters Supporting Kerry requests from clients and internally asking for info if no specific report query system to generate E g server tech data extract Support where data loads failed Most of work is BAU Andy does engineering side expert in PowerBI Steve creates analysis from data external face of business Interpretation of data sees commercial bids etc Spends a lot of his time telling people what theyre looking for Manipulating data for customer facing packs decks Inflexible macro Own investigations into customer travel behaviour booking times ticket types etc advanced purchases lead times etc Firefighting Problem solving E g this week report built for customer needed to mirror some console report from finance For some reason they dont match understand why theyre different Had all data feeds correct for 2020 but 2019 fields in MI arent where they were in 2020 Cost ctre1 from one field to another due to movement of inputs of data Nothing dominant Manual process on NYS MI subscription updates deleting subscriptions update email addresses etc Fixing errors in SSRS Data engineering enjoys etl Likes doing reports would prefer engineering and Azure Main impact is time spent to show people how to use tools to get info from data provided Teach people More involvement in customers business understand them more More time with team customer initiatives to improve cust Experience from contract mgmt more facetime and visbility Anything to help retain sell more services P L review margins as travel volumes change typically only looked at during contract start and renewal not changing throughout contract monthly quarterly New team so time where management needs for people Get away from firefighting and more into people handovers etc Technically a team manager but mostly in the work Would do more looking after the team Step back review processes why we doing etc Prune manual work and time Building better MI Develop proper automated meetings pro MI Create new reports designs New things Chronos No insight see Mark Read profile imports Some external data market intelligence monthly from TRI excel file If getting tenders sometimes get tenders Some COVID lockdown levels tiers mapped to hotel locations for changes routing etc External hotel rate data could be pulled in but isnt Havent bothered issue is finding right data skewed to make things look better None will ask across the team Data sent to global star externally Sys packages out to Prism monthly SSRS exports sending info to customers vis SFTP Dave recs file from customer that imports to client divisions table Some files sent to BA Incoming is generally looked after by Mark Reed Some via email Supplier feed Car hire data from Enterprise for NYS MI Other data feeds handled by IT or Dave Mostly already present in SQL Facilitating the reports providing missing data Operational planning Heads trending etc Resource planning Fills in gaps with internal reporting Behavioural scientist Customer requests policy change they try to deliver Generate data points to help inform psychology to generate outcome Customers dont pay for changes say yes too often without charging Work becomes value add some charging for campaigns Only business depts not really working with is finance Works with internal and external Creates reports and powerpoint to show customers where they can save money avg costs etc Stunng reports could be created in dashboards show radars interact to see where things can be improved and how Smarter working typically offered at renewal time Persona group mapping clustering analysis at basic level regular infrequent frequent and saving opportunities Avoid unnecessary travel do so smartly do with wellbeing in mind Customer retention maximising what we sell to customers Charge customers effectively and for everything Make sure chat is delivered is charged Managing cust Expectations around contracts and creep No report counts Monthly MI scheduled e g all reports for cust X by 5th SLAs on vivantio ticket system raise report request with SLA request includled Report run then QCd before sent back Can request report raw data analysis etc Some direct email requests Looks after process that gets meetings pro data into flat table production data Meetings pro was the system in NYS so has the expertise Internal Considered developing for external customers considered beyond scope Loves his PowerBI Used on 365 with gateway server and onto 365 platform Uses gateway to store credentials Badly implimented not enough buy in for the business Slow Doesnt have the data for additional reports Poor performance even against flat tables Kerry in charge of reports and destinations Dave investigates missing data issues etc Internal and external Dont share data of POE to customer powerpoint only Internally the detailed reports 1 KPI performance against forecast Month
